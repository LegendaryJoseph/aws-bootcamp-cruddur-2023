# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

I installed the Docker extension which I did not initially have

I also installed Docker desktop and started containers

I ensured the backend and the frontend are communicating with multiple containers mounted correctly

I had an issue with the environment variables but I managed to debug them

I mastered how to read logs and identify the errors or bugs

Practiced with Docker commands and even watched further videos on Docker containerization.
